// Package gnsmath implements core mathematical operations for GnoSwap's AMM.
//
// This package provides the fundamental calculations for concentrated liquidity,
// including sqrt price math, swap calculations, and bit manipulation utilities.
// All operations use Q96 and Q160 fixed-point arithmetic for precision.
//
// The implementation follows Uniswap V3's mathematical model, ensuring
// compatibility and correctness for cross-chain liquidity operations.
