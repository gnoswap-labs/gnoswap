# GnoSwap Governance Module

This module empowers $GNS token holders to participate in the decentralized governance of the GnoSwap protocol. Through staking, delegation, proposal creation, and voting mechanisms, the community can influence the platform's evolution.

## Overview

The governance system comprises several key realms:

- **Staker Realm (`staker.gno`)**: Manages staking, delegation, and reward collection.
- **Proposal Realm (`proposal.gno`)**: Facilitates the creation and management of governance proposals.
- **Vote Realm (`vote.gno`)**: Oversees the voting process on active proposals.

## Key Components

### Staker Realm (`staker.gno`)

- **Delegation Functions:**
  - `Delegate(to std.Address, amount uint64)`: Delegate voting power to a specified address.
  - `Redelegate(from std.Address, to std.Address, amount uint64)`: Reassign delegated voting power to a different delegate.
  - `Undelegate(from std.Address, amount uint64)`: Retract delegated voting power.

- **Reward Functions:**
  - `CollectReward()`: Collect accumulated rewards based on staked tokens.
  - `CollectRewardFromLaunchPad(to std.Address)`: Collect rewards associated with the launchpad contract.

### Proposal Realm (`proposal.gno`)

- **Proposal Creation**: Users can submit proposals suggesting protocol changes or new features. Each proposal includes parameters such as the proposal's content, the proposerâ€™s address, and the submission timestamp.

### Vote Realm (`vote.gno`)

- **Voting Process**: Users cast their votes on active proposals during the voting period. The system records and tallies these votes to determine the outcome of each proposal.

## Interaction Flow

1. **Staking & Delegation**: Users stake their $GNS tokens to receive xGNS, representing their voting power. They can delegate this voting power to themselves or other delegates.

2. **Proposal Creation**: With sufficient GNS, users can create proposals suggesting protocol changes or new features.

3. **Voting**: During the voting period, xGNS holders cast their votes on active proposals. The outcome is determined based on the majority of votes and predefined quorum requirements.

4. **Execution**: Approved proposals are executed, implementing the proposed changes within the protocol.
