# GnoSwap Launchpad

Platform for launching early-stage GRC20 projects. Users stake GNS tokens for fixed periods, earning project tokens while keeping principal intact.

## Key Components

### Initialization
- Create launchpad pools with reward allocation, duration, and deposit limits
- Configure participation rules and reward structures

### Deposits
- Lock GNS tokens in project pools
- Staked tokens generate yield via governance contract

### Rewards
- Distribute project tokens based on staked GNS
- Claim tokens during or after pool duration

## Flow

1. Project teams create pools
2. Users deposit GNS
3. Earn project tokens over time
4. Claim rewards
5. Retrieve original GNS after period ends

## Notes

- GNS locked until pool maturity
- Yield supports project development
- Earn project tokens based on deposit share
- No additional governance power from deposits
