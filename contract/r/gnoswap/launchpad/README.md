# Launchpad

The **GnoSwap Launchpad** is a decentralized token launching platform built on **gno.land**, enabling new projects to launch tokens in a **fair, transparent, and trustless** manner.

## Key Concepts

1. "Lossless" Exposure to Early-Stage Projects
GnoSwap Launchpad allows **$GNS holders** to acquire new project tokens **without spending their principal $GNS**. Users lock their **$GNS tokens** in a Launchpad Pool for a fixed period and receive project tokens **pro-rata** while their staked $GNS remains secured in the **xGNS Governance Contract**. After maturity, the same amount of $GNS is returned, ensuring a **"lossless" participation model**.

2. Pool Diversity
Users can choose from **three different pools**, each with varying lock-up periods and reward structures:
- **1 Month** – Short-term commitment, moderate rewards.
- **3 Months** – Balanced duration and rewards.
- **6 Months** – Longer commitment, higher token rewards.

While $GNS remains locked, **project token rewards are liquid** and can be claimed at any time.

3. Yield-Redirection-Based Funding
GnoSwap Launchpad uses a **yield-redirection mechanism** to fund project token rewards.  
- Users' **$GNS deposits** are **staked** in the [xGNS Governance Contract](https://github.com/gnoswap-labs/gnoswap/tree/main/contract/r/gnoswap/gov), earning **Protocol Fee Rewards**.  
- Instead of being returned to users, these **rewards are redirected** to the **Project Owner** in exchange for **newly launching project tokens**.
