# Launchpad Module: Block-based to Timestamp-based Calculation Changes

## Summary
Successfully converted the launchpad module from block-based to timestamp-based reward calculations. All field names have been renamed from "PerBlock" to "PerSecond" and the calculation logic now uses timestamps instead of block heights.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. reward_manager.gno

#### calculateRewardPerDepositX128() - COMPLETED ✅
**Changed from (block-based):**
```go
blockDuration := currentHeight - accumulatedHeight
totalRewardX128 := u256.Zero().Mul(u256.NewUintFromInt64(blockDuration), rewardPerSecondX128)
```

**To (timestamp-based):**
```go
timeDuration := currentTime - accumulatedTime
totalRewardX128 := u256.Zero().Mul(u256.NewUintFromInt64(timeDuration), rewardPerSecondX128)
```

#### updateDistributeAmountPerSecondX128() - COMPLETED ✅
**Changed from (block-based):**
```go
blockDuration := distributeEndHeight - distributeStartHeight
totalDistributeAmountX128 := u256.Zero().Lsh(u256.NewUintFromInt64(totalDistributeAmount), 128)
amountPerBlockX128 := u256.Zero().Div(totalDistributeAmountX128, u256.NewUintFromInt64(blockDuration))
```

**To (timestamp-based):**
```go
timeDuration := distributeEndTime - distributeStartTime
totalDistributeAmountX128 := u256.Zero().Lsh(u256.NewUintFromInt64(totalDistributeAmount), 128)
amountPerSecondX128 := u256.Zero().Div(totalDistributeAmountX128, u256.NewUintFromInt64(timeDuration))
```

### 2. project_tier.gno

#### updateDistributeAmountPerSecond() - COMPLETED ✅
**Changed from (block-based):**
```go
distributeBlockCount := t.endBlockTimeInfo.BlockHeight() - t.startBlockTimeInfo.BlockHeight()
totalDistributeAmountX128 := new(u256.Uint).Mul(u256.NewUintFromInt64(t.totalDistributeAmount), q128.Clone())
distributeAmountPerSecondX128 := new(u256.Uint).Div(totalDistributeAmountX128, u256.NewUintFromInt64(distributeBlockCount))
```

**To (timestamp-based):**
```go
distributeTimeDuration := t.endBlockTimeInfo.BlockTime() - t.startBlockTimeInfo.BlockTime()
totalDistributeAmountX128 := new(u256.Uint).Mul(u256.NewUintFromInt64(t.totalDistributeAmount), q128.Clone())
distributeAmountPerSecondX128 := new(u256.Uint).Div(totalDistributeAmountX128, u256.NewUintFromInt64(distributeTimeDuration))
```

### 3. Data Structure Changes - COMPLETED ✅

Added timestamp fields to RewardManager struct:
- Added `accumulatedTime` field to track last calculation time
- Added `distributeStartTime` and `distributeEndTime` fields
- Updated all methods to use time-based calculations

### 4. Test Updates - COMPLETED ✅

Added comprehensive tests for timestamp-based calculations:
- `TestTimestampBasedRewardCalculation_ConstantTime` - Verifies rewards are calculated based on time elapsed
- `TestTimestampBasedRewardCalculation_VariableBlockTime` - Tests with variable block times
- `TestCollectDepositReward_VaryingBlockTimes` - Tests fast/slow/irregular block patterns
- `TestCollectDepositReward_TimeBoundaries` - Tests edge cases around time boundaries
- `TestProjectTier_VaryingBlockTimes` - Verifies tier calculations are time-based
- `TestProjectTier_UpdateDistributeAmountPerSecond` - Tests per-second distribution calculation

## Summary

Successfully implemented timestamp-based reward calculations in the launchpad module:
- ✅ All block-based calculations converted to timestamp-based
- ✅ Field names updated from "PerBlock" to "PerSecond"
- ✅ Added comprehensive tests verifying correct behavior
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ No mockups, workarounds, or TODO items
- ✅ Properly uses time.Now() for current block time
- ✅ Maintains block height for state tracking while using time for calculations
