# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you've identified a vulnerability, please **DO NOT** open a new public issue. Instead, report it through one of the following venues:

* Submit an advisory through GitHub: https://github.com/gnoswap-labs/gnoswap/security/advisories/new
* Email info [at-symbol] gnoswap [dot] io. If you are concerned about confidentiality e.g. because of a high-severity issue, you may email us for PGP or Signal contact details. If youâ€™ve found multiple vulnerabilities, please submit one per email.

We will respond within 3 business days to all received reports.

Thank you for helping to keep our ecosystem safe!
