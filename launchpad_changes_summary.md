# Launchpad Module Changes Summary

## Completed Changes

### 1. Field Renaming (✅ Completed)
- Renamed all fields from `distributeAmountPerBlockX128` to `distributeAmountPerSecondX128`
- Updated all getter methods to match the new naming
- Updated all references in test files

### 2. Timestamp-based Calculation Implementation (✅ Completed)

#### reward_manager.gno
- **Added timestamp fields to RewardManager struct**:
  - `distributeStartTime int64` - start time of reward distribution
  - `distributeEndTime int64` - end time of reward distribution  
  - `accumulatedTime int64` - last time when reward was calculated
  
- **Updated calculateRewardPerDepositX128()**:
  - Now accepts `currentTime int64` parameter
  - Uses `timeDuration := currentTime - accumulatedTime` instead of block duration
  - All time comparisons now use timestamps instead of heights

- **Updated updateDistributeAmountPerSecondX128()**:
  - Now accepts `distributeStartTime` and `distributeEndTime` parameters
  - Calculates `timeDuration := distributeEndTime - distributeStartTime`
  - Divides by time duration in seconds for true per-second calculation

- **Updated addRewardPerDepositX128()**:
  - Now accepts `currentTime` parameter
  - Updates both `accumulatedHeight` and `accumulatedTime`

- **Updated updateRewardPerDepositX128()**:
  - Now accepts `time int64` parameter
  - Validates time is positive
  - Passes time to calculation methods

- **Updated NewRewardManager constructor**:
  - Now accepts `distributeStartTime` and `distributeEndTime` parameters
  - Initializes all time-related fields

#### project_tier.gno
- **Updated updateDistributeAmountPerSecond()**:
  - Now uses `distributeTimeDuration := t.endBlockTimeInfo.BlockTime() - t.startBlockTimeInfo.BlockTime()`
  - Divides by time duration in seconds instead of block count

#### launchpad_project.gno
- **Updated NewRewardManager call**:
  - Now passes `projectTier.StartTime()` and `projectTier.EndTime()` 
  - Passes `params.currentTime` for initialization

#### launchpad_withdraw.gno, launchpad_reward.gno, launchpad_deposit.gno
- Added `time` import
- Updated all `updateRewardPerDepositX128()` calls to include `time.Now().Unix()` 

## Current State
- ✅ All field names have been renamed to reflect per-second calculations
- ✅ Timestamp fields added to RewardManager struct
- ✅ All calculation logic now uses timestamps instead of block heights
- ✅ All method signatures updated to accept time parameters
- ✅ All method calls updated to pass current time
- ✅ True per-second reward distribution implemented

## Design Decisions

### Why Height Fields Are Retained
While the reward calculations are now timestamp-based, height fields are retained for:
1. **State Tracking**: Heights track when deposits were made and when rewards become claimable
2. **Validation**: Heights are used to validate reward collection eligibility 
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Other parts of the system may depend on height-based state tracking
4. **Audit Trail**: Heights provide blockchain-specific reference points for when events occurred

The key achievement is that reward distribution calculations (`distributeAmountPerSecondX128`) now use actual time duration in seconds, providing accurate per-second reward distribution regardless of block time variations.

## Test Updates (✅ Completed)
1. Updated test files:
   - Updated NewRewardManager calls to include time parameters (distributeStartTime, distributeEndTime, currentTime)
   - Updated all updateRewardPerDepositX128 calls to include time parameter
   - Tests now use `time.Now().Unix()` to generate realistic timestamps
   - All reward manager tests are passing and validating timestamp-based reward distribution
   
2. Fixed compilation issues:
   - Added missing time parameter to updateRewardPerDepositX128 call in launchpad_deposit.gno
   - Tests now properly validate that reward calculations use time duration in seconds
   
## Timestamp-Based Verification Tests (✅ Completed)
Added two comprehensive tests to verify timestamp-based reward calculation logic:

1. **TestTimestampBasedRewardCalculation_ConstantTime**:
   - Tests that rewards are distributed based on time duration (100 seconds)
   - Verifies rewards are calculated correctly at 50% and 100% time elapsed
   - Confirms proper reward sharing between multiple deposits
   - Test passes successfully

2. **TestTimestampBasedRewardCalculation_VariableBlockTime**:
   - Tests reward calculation with irregular block times (blocks coming at 30s and 50s intervals)
   - Verifies that rewards are still based on actual time elapsed, not block count
   - Confirms correct reward distribution when deposits join at different times
   - Test passes successfully

## Summary
All launchpad module changes for timestamp-based reward calculations have been successfully implemented and tested. The module now calculates rewards based on actual time duration in seconds rather than block counts, providing more accurate and predictable reward distribution. The verification tests confirm that the timestamp-based logic works correctly even with variable block times.
